      <p>
        Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City,[8][9] to 23-year-old
        Stanley Johnson, an Englishman, then studying economics at Columbia University,[10] and his 22-year-old wife of
        one year Charlotte Fawcett,[11] an Oxford-born artist from a family of liberal intellectuals, and a daughter of
        Sir James Fawcett, a barrister. Boris's parents had married in 1963 before moving to the US,[12] where they
        lived opposite the Chelsea Hotel

        Johnson gained a King's Scholarship to study at Eton College, the elite independent boarding school near Windsor
        in Berkshire.[39] Arriving in the autumn term of 1977,[40] he began using as his given name Boris rather than
        Alex, and developed "the eccentric English persona" for which he became famous.[41] He abandoned his mother's
        Catholicism and became an Anglican, joining the Church of England.[42] School reports complained about his
        idleness, complacency and lateness,

      <p>
        In September 1987, Johnson and Mostyn-Owen were married in West Felton, Shropshire, accompanied by a duet for
        violin and viola Allegra e Boris[70] specially commissioned for the wedding from Hans Werner Henze.[71] After a
        honeymoon in Egypt, they settled in West Kensington, West London,[72] when Johnson secured work for a management
        consultancy company, L.E.K. Consulting, but resigned after a week.[73] Through family connections, in late 1987
        he began work as a graduate trainee at The Times.

      <h3> <em> Political columnist:1994–1999 </em></h3>
      <p>
        Back in London, Hastings turned down Johnson's request to become a war reporter,[98] instead promoting him to
        the position of assistant editor and chief political columnist.[99] Johnson's column received praise for being
        ideologically eclectic and distinctively written, and earned him a Commentator of the Year Award at the What the
        Papers Say awards.[100] His writing style was condemned by some critics as bigotry; in various columns he used
        the words "piccannies" and "watermelon smiles" when referring to Africans, championed European colonialism in
        Uganda[101][102][103] and referred to gay men as "tank-topped bumboys".

        <h3> <em> Mayoral election </em></h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        In July 2007, Johnson announced his candidacy to be the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London in the 2008
        mayoral election[176][177] and in September was selected after gaining 79% of the vote in a public London-wide
        primary.

        <h3>First term</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Settling into the City Hall mayoral office,[188] Johnson's first official engagement was an appearance at the
        Sikh celebrations for Vaisakhi in Trafalgar Square.[189] Rather than bringing a team of assistants with him to
        the job as Livingstone had done, Johnson built his team over the following six months.

        <h3> <em> Second term </em></h3>

      <p>
        London was successful in its bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics while Ken Livingstone was still mayor in 2005.
        Johnson's role in the proceedings was to be the co-chair of an Olympic board which oversaw the games.[267] Two
        of his actions subsequent to taking on this role were to improve the transport around London by making more
        tickets available and laying on more buses around the capital during the busy period, when thousands of
        spectators were temporary visitors in London,[268][269] and also to allow shops and supermarkets to have longer
        opening hours on Sundays.
